For project four, I wanted to continue learning and improving from my project two XML database. Initially I wanted to add book covers to my database along with a hover function. For more intensive things, I hoped to create a sort function and have the book description nested within the book title. 

I began with the database that a created outside of a table. I was able to successfully add some of the functions I wanted, but could not get it to sort since it was not in a table. At that point I switched back to my database in a table, made the changes in color and fonts and continued with that project. 

I was able to easily add the book covers and the hover function. I had difficulty trying to get the sorting function to work. I tried looking up answers on stackoverflow and other help sites, but still could not figure out how to link the genres in the dropdown list to the actual books, though with Dr. Lam’s help, I was able to get the table to sort by author name. Since I was unable to get this function to fully work, I created a hyperlink under each author biography that links to their homepage on Amazon. I didn’t have much space left in my table so I placed the link inside the author’s biography section. Because of the same problem, I decided to drop the typed out book title for the actual book cover. This allows the user to read the title and see the visuals of the book cover. 

There was more I wanted to do with this project, but with my limited time and knowledge, I wasn’t able to complete it. I was, however, extremely happy with the outcome. Learning how the computer thinks and learning the syntax has been interesting and rewarding.
